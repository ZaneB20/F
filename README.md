# F
For documentation purposes i will just use the README.md
I started by looking at the example code from the cs120 class to get an idea of what i should have mine look like
after that i just tried to get the starting deck to work 
after that i added the enemies to fight which didnâ€™t take long since they where basically the same as the character
Then i added the remove card function and added the turn system 
I also added the combat system right after the turn system so you could actually fight
then i added the add card function where it will randomly add one of the three cards to you deck after each round and it will tell you what card you get
then i finalized by adding the win condition and the ability to play again
after that i wanted to add a little more so i added the turn counter so you can see how many turns it took you to win. And you will see what turn your on while fighting









features that look weird 
 
 (NumberFormatException e) --- i got this little gem from stack overflow, i saw it on there while trying to find code on how to make the choice section for what card to use. the (NumberFormatException e) makes it to where you cant enter anything but a number as a valid answer if you try puts out the ("Invalid input. Please enter a number: ") and then trys to get a valid input 

 - i think it works well
